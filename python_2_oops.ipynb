    "1. **Local Variables**:\n",
    "   - Local variables are defined within a function or a code block (such as a loop or a conditional statement).\n",
    "   - They are only accessible within the scope (function or code block) in which they are defined.\n",
    "   - ⭐️ Local variables are created when the function is called or the code block is executed, and they are destroyed when the function returns or the code block completes.\n",
    "   - `Use cases:` Local variables are typically used to store temporary data or intermediate results within a function or code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Variables**:\n",
    "   - Instance variables are defined within a class and belong to a specific instance (object) of that class.\n",
    "   - Each instance (object) of the class has its own copy of the instance variables.\n",
    "   - ⭐️ Instance variables are accessed and modified through the instance (object) of the class.\n",
    "   - `Use cases:` Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance (object) of a class. They are commonly used to represent the state or attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Class Variables**:\n",
    "   - Class variables are defined within a class but outside of any methods.\n",
    "   - They are shared among all instances (objects) of the class.\n",
    "   - If a class variable is modified through one instance, the change is reflected in all other instances as well.\n",
    "   - ⭐️ Class variables are accessible through both the class itself and its instances (objects).\n",
    "   - `Use cases:` Class variables are typically used to store data that is common to all instances of a class, such as constants or configuration settings. They can also be used to keep track of class-level information or statistics."
