    "   - They are only accessible within the scope (function or code block) in which they are defined.\n",
    "   - ⭐️ Local variables are created when the function is called or the code block is executed, and they are destroyed when the function returns or the code block completes.\n",
    "   - `Use cases:` Local variables are typically used to store temporary data or intermediate results within a function or code block.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Instance Variables**:\n",
    "   - Instance variables are defined within a class and belong to a specific instance (object) of that class.\n",
    "   - Each instance (object) of the class has its own copy of the instance variables.\n",
    "   - ⭐️ Instance variables are accessed and modified through the instance (object) of the class.\n",
    "   - `Use cases:` Instance variables are used to store data that is unique to each instance (object) of a class. They are commonly used to represent the state or attributes of an object.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Class variables are defined within a class but outside of any methods.\n",

    "In Python, the `abc` (Abstract Base Classes) module provides a way to define abstract base classes, which are a fundamental concept in achieving abstraction. Abstraction is one of the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and involves hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features or interfaces to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `abc` module allows you to define abstract base classes and enforce a common interface for a set of related classes. By defining an abstract base class, you can specify the methods and properties that must be implemented by any concrete subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Abstract Base Classes (ABCs)**: An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, it serves as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from and implement its abstract methods and properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining ABCs**: To define an abstract base class in Python, you need to import the `ABC` class from the `abc` module and use it as the base class for your abstract class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from abc import ABC, abstractmethod\n",
    "\n",
    "   class AbstractClass(ABC):\n",
    "       @abstractmethod\n",
    "       def abstract_method(self):\n",
    "           pass\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In the example above, `AbstractClass` is an abstract base class that defines an abstract method `abstract_method`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Abstract Methods**: Abstract methods are declared using the `@abstractmethod` decorator from the `abc` module. They have no implementation in the abstract base class, and any concrete subclass must provide an implementation for them.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Concrete Subclasses**: Concrete subclasses are classes that inherit from an abstract base class and provide implementations for all the abstract methods defined in the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class ConcreteClass(AbstractClass):\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   In this example, `ConcreteClass` inherits from `AbstractClass` and provides an implementation for the `abstract_method`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Enforcing Abstraction**: The `abc` module enforces abstraction by raising a `TypeError` if you try to instantiate an abstract base class or if a concrete subclass fails to implement all the required abstract methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Properties and Methods**: In addition to abstract methods, abstract base classes can also define concrete methods and properties. These can be used by the concrete subclasses without requiring reimplementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Multiple Inheritance**: Python supports multiple inheritance, which means a concrete class can inherit from multiple abstract base classes, combining their interfaces and implementing all the required abstract methods."

    "# 1. Method Overriding\n",
    "Method overriding is a concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) where a subclass provides its own implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to give a specific behavior to a method inherited from the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Animal:\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The animal makes a sound.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "    def make_sound(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The dog barks.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "dog.make_sound()  # Output: The dog barks.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `Dog` class overrides the `make_sound` method inherited from the `Animal` class. When `make_sound` is called on the `dog` object, the overridden method in the `Dog` class is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Method overriding is commonly used to provide class-specific implementations of methods inherited from a superclass, allowing for polymorphic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Method Overloading**:\n",
    "Method overloading is a concept where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (either different number of parameters or different types of parameters). The correct method is called based on the arguments passed during the method call.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Python does not support true method overloading out of the box. However, it can be simulated using default arguments, variable-length arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`), or by using single dispatch decorators from the `functools` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example (using default arguments):\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Calculator:\n",
    "    def add(self, a, b=0):\n",
    "        return a + b\n",
    "\n",
    "calc = Calculator()\n",
    "print(calc.add(2, 3))  # Output: 5\n",
    "print(calc.add(5))     # Output: 5 (b defaults to 0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `add` method is \"overloaded\" with different parameter combinations. The correct method is called based on the number of arguments passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Method overloading is useful when you want to provide multiple ways to call the same method with different sets of parameters, promoting code readability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Operator Overloading (or Overriding)**:\n",
    "Operator overloading (or overriding) is a feature in Python that allows you to define the behavior of operators (`+, -, *, /`, etc.) for custom classes. This is done by defining special methods in the class, which are automatically called when the corresponding operator is used on objects of that class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Vector:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x, y):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __add__(self, other:'Vector'):\n",
    "        return Vector(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"({self.x}, {self.y})\"\n",
    "\n",
    "v1 = Vector(2, 3)\n",
    "v2 = Vector(4, 5)\n",
    "v3 = v1 + v2\n",
    "print(v3)  # Output: (6, 8)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the `__add__` method is overridden to define the behavior of the `+` operator for `Vector` objects. When `v1 + v2` is executed, Python automatically calls the `__add__` method, allowing you to define how vectors should be added.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case: Operator overloading is used to provide a more intuitive and natural way of working with custom objects by giving meaning to operators in the context of those objects. It makes the code more readable and easier to understand."
